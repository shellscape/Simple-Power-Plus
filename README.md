Simple, quick power functions for Windows 8 from the tray.

*But Why?*

Getting to all of the power options in Windows 8 is just a royal pain. Sure, you've got some hotkeys you could memorize, or we could even install a Start Menu replacement. 
I actually don't miss the Start Menu all that much. I do, however spend 99.9999% of my time in Desktop mode.

Enter Simple Power Plus.

Simple Power Plus provides access to all of the power-related options in Windows 8, and sits quietly in the system tray until called upon. It's that simple.
